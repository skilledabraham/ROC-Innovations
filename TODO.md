# TODO: Add Tailwind CSS to React Vite Project

- [x] Install Tailwind CSS, autoprefixer, and postcss as dev dependencies
- [x] Create Tailwind config and PostCSS config manually (since init failed)
- [x] Update `tailwind.config.js` to scan for classes in `./src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}`
- [x] Modify `src/index.css` to include Tailwind directives and comment out existing styles
- [x] Update `src/App.jsx` to use proper Tailwind classes (change `bg-red` to `bg-red-500`)
- [x] Run `npm run dev` to start the dev server and verify Tailwind classes work
- [x] Test the app in the browser (browser tool disabled, but dev server is running at http://localhost:5174/)
